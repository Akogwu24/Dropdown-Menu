# Detailed Plan for Dropdown Menu Component

### **1. Component Structure and Core Functionality**

- **Create a dedicated component:** A new React component, e.g., `DropdownMenu.tsx`, will encapsulate all dropdown logic, UI, and accessibility features.
- **State Management:** Use React's `useState` hook to manage the open/closed state of the dropdown.
- **Trigger Element:** The component will accept a trigger element (e.g., a button) that toggles the dropdown's visibility.
- **Menu Items:** The component will accept an array of menu items as props, allowing for dynamic rendering and future extensibility. Each item will have properties like `label`, `value`, and an optional `onClick` handler.

### **2. Accessibility (ARIA Attributes & Keyboard Navigation)**

- **ARIA Roles:**
  - The trigger button will have `aria-haspopup="true"` and `aria-expanded` (dynamically set to `true` or `false` based on menu state).
  - The menu container will have `role="menu"`.
  - Each menu item will have `role="menuitem"`.
- **Keyboard Navigation:**
  - **Tab:** Allow tabbing to the trigger button.
  - **Enter/Space:** Activate the trigger button to open/close the menu.
  - **Arrow Keys (Up/Down):** Navigate between menu items when the menu is open.
  - **Escape:** Close the menu and return focus to the trigger button.
  - **Home/End:** Move focus to the first/last menu item.
- **Focus Management:**
  - When the menu opens, focus should automatically shift to the first menu item.
  - When the menu closes, focus should return to the trigger button.
  - Implement a mechanism to trap focus within the dropdown when it's open, preventing users from tabbing outside until the menu is closed.
- **Screen Reader Support:** Ensure all interactive elements have meaningful labels and descriptions.

### **3. Animation**

- **CSS Transitions/Animations:** Utilize CSS transitions or animations for smooth opening and closing effects (e.g., fade-in/out, slide-down).
- **Tailwind CSS:** Leverage Tailwind CSS classes for easy styling and animation definitions, potentially using `transition`, `duration`, and `opacity` classes.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Render the menu items only when the dropdown is open to optimize performance and simplify animation logic.

### **4. Extensibility**

- **Props-based Configuration:** The component will be highly configurable via props:
  - `items`: An array of objects defining menu items.
  - `trigger`: The React element that acts as the dropdown toggle.
  - `onSelect`: A callback function when a menu item is selected.
  - `direction`: (Optional) To control dropdown direction (e.g., `down`, `up`, `left`, `right`).
- **Dynamic Item Rendering:** Map over the `items` prop to render menu items, making it easy to add or remove items without modifying the core component logic.

### **5. Best Practices**

- **Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate HTML elements (`<button>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`) for better structure and accessibility.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Keep UI logic, state management, and accessibility concerns well-separated within the component.
- **Performance:** Optimize rendering by avoiding unnecessary re-renders. Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` where appropriate.
- **Code Readability:** Write clean, well-structured, and commented code.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle cases where props are missing or malformed.

### **6. Security**

- **Client-Side Focus:** As a client-side UI component, direct security vulnerabilities are minimal. The primary concern is ensuring proper input validation if menu item labels or actions are derived from untrusted sources (though typically, these would be hardcoded or come from a trusted API).
- **No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`:** Avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution, as it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

### **7. Documentation**

- **JSDoc/TSDoc:** Document component props, state, and methods using JSDoc or TSDoc comments for clear API understanding.
- **README.md Update:** Add a section to the `README.md` file explaining how to use the `DropdownMenu` component, including examples.
- **Example Usage:** Provide a clear example of how to integrate the component into `src/app/page.tsx` or a new example page.

### **8. Test Cases**

- **Unit Tests (React Testing Library/Jest):**
  - Test component rendering with various props.
  - Test open/close functionality on trigger click.
  - Test keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Enter, Escape, Tab).
  - Test focus management (focus on open, focus return on close).
  - Test `onSelect` callback invocation when an item is clicked/selected.
  - Test ARIA attributes are correctly applied and updated.
- **Snapshot Tests:** Ensure the UI doesn't change unexpectedly.
- **Accessibility Tests:** Use tools like `jest-axe` to check for common accessibility violations in tests.
